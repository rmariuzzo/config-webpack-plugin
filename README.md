# config-webpack-plugin

> 💫 Merge a configuration file with environment variables.

## How it works?

The `config-webpack-plugin` will **intercept a JS configuration file** during webpack's compilation time. The specified configuration file will be modified with any matching **environment variables**.

## Installation

```sh
npm install config-webpack-plugin --save-dev
```

## Usage

```js
const ConfigPlugin = require('config-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
    // ...
    plugins: [
        new ConfigPlugin('./config')
    ]
    // ...
}
```

*That's it!* The first and unique parameter is a string containing the relative path of the configuration file you want for `config-webpack-plugin` to intercept.

### What is a configuration file.

Currently, `config-webpack-plugin` support a simple type of JS configuration file that export an object where key-value pairs represents key-value configurations:

```js
module.exports = {
    API_BASE_URL: 'http://localhost/',
    NODE_ENV: 'development',
    AUTH_SPOOFED: true,
}
```

### Roadmap

 - [ ] Add test. Please!
 - [ ] Add CI. Please!
